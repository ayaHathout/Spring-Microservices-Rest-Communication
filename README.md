# Spring Cloud Microservices Demo

A comprehensive, step-by-step implementation of Spring Cloud microservices architecture. 
This project demonstrates real-world microservices patterns with practical examples.

---

## 🚀 Implemented Features
- ✅ REST Communication: RestTemplate vs OpenFeign Client
- ✅ Service Discovery & Registration: Eureka Server & Clients
- ✅ Spring Boot Microservices Architecture
- ✅ PostgreSQL & MySQL integration

---

## 📚 Learning Path
1. Basic RESTful microservices
2. Service-to-service communication
3. Centralized service discovery
4. API Gateway (Coming soon)
5. Distributed configuration (Coming soon)
6. Circuit Breaker pattern (Coming soon)
